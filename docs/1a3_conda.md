# Conda

From the website, `conda` provides ["Package, dependency and environment management for any language"](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

Conda is a package manager allows specific versions of programs to be installed, alongside their dependencies.
Different sets of programs can be installed to different [virtual environments](https://www.anaconda.com/moving-conda-environments/).
A virtual environment is basically a set of programs.

## Installing `conda`

Conda is part of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), which is available for free.
Conda is also available through [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), a free minimal installer for conda.

Conda can be installed on a 64-bit Linux system with the following commands...

```bash
# Downloading miniconda
$ wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
# Installing miniconda
$ bash miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda
# Updating conda
$ conda update -q conda
```

## Cloning and activating a `conda` environment

Conda virtual environments can be shared, either as a `.yml` file or a `.txt` file.
A `.yml` copy of a conda environment can be used to recreate that environment on another machine, regardless of the operating system platform used.
A `.txt` copy of a conda environment is more explicit: it can be used to create an identical copy of a conda environment using the same operating system platform as the original machine.
A conda virtual environment is used throughout this project: a [`.yml` copy](../envs/bioinfo-notebook.yml) and an [explicit `.txt` copy](../envs/bioinfo-notebook.txt) of this conda environment are provided.

A conda environment can be activated using `$ conda activate name_of_environment`.
Once activated, the programs installed in this environment are available.
Conda can be deactivated using `$ conda deactivate`.

The `conda` environment used throughout this project can be created from [bioinfo-notebook.txt](../envs/bioinfo-notebook.txt) and activated using the following commands...

```bash
# Creating the bioinfo-notebook environment
/bioinfo-notebook $ conda create --name bioinfo-notebook --file envs/bioinfo-notebook.txt
# Activating the bioinfo-notebook environment
$ conda activate bioinfo-notebook
# Once activated, the environment name is at the start of the bash prompt
(bioinfo-notebook) $
```

## Demonstration

In this video demonstration, a conda virtual environment is created using [bioinfo-notebook.txt](../envs/bioinfo-notebook.txt).
This virtual environment is then activated using `conda activate bioinfo-notebook`.
Note that the name of the active conda environment is displayed in brackets at the start of the bash prompt: `(name of active environment) ... $`.
